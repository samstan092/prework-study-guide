# Prework Study Guide


## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide website, that I build to have a spot to take and keep notes in for future use. This solves the problem of not having all your notes in one easy to access location.







## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the Study Guide, you can review the notes under each section. For a list of what there is to study and for suggestions, open the Chrome DevTools and view the console.
